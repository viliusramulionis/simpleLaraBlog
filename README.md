<h1>Simple Laravel Blog for BIT Students</h1>

App contains seeders for both admin users and posts generation.
Copy and rename file '.env.example' to '.env' and setup your application configuration.

First run command  `composer install` in order to add dependencies.

Command `npm install` will update nodejs module vendors.

`php artisan migrate` run laravel migrations 

Run `php artisan passport:install --force` in order to generate authentification migrations and keys.

If running app in development mode you'll need to setup two separate terminals and launch `npm run dev` for vite resource server.

Finally to launch main application run `php artisan serve` and open app with given localhost port.

<h2>Database seeder</h2>

If you want to seed database with automatically generated admin user run command:
`php artisan db:seed`
username: admin@bit.lt
password: password

When user is generated you'll have the ability to fill database with 10 automatically generated posts in each launch. 
Run command `php artisan db:seed PostsSeeder` and voil√† your all set.

Happy coding!
